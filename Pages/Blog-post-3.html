      <h2>1. JavaScript (Node.js)</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Node.js </b>has become a widely-used backend technology due to its
        ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently. It uses JavaScript, which
        allows developers to use the same language for both frontend and backend
        development, streamlining the development process.
      </p>
      <h3>Why choose Node.js?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Improve code readability:</b> Abstracting details makes code easier
